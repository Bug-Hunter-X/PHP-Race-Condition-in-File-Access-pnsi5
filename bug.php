This code suffers from a race condition.  Two processes might attempt to update the same file simultaneously, leading to data corruption or loss. Consider the scenario where `process1` reads the value 10, then `process2` reads the value as well, and then both attempt to increment and write back. The last one to write wins, potentially overwriting the change done by the other process.
